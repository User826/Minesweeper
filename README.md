Game Instructions
The goal of the game is to uncover all cells on the grid without detonating any mines.

Left-click on a cell to uncover it. The number displayed in a cell indicates the number of mines adjacent to that cell.

Right-click on a cell to flag it as a mine. This helps you keep track of the cells you suspect contain mines.

If you uncover a mine, the game ends.

Use the numbers on the grid to strategically deduce the locations of mines and uncover safe cells.
